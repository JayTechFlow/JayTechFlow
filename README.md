💡 Core Mission: Engineer for Resilience

My mandate is simple: Reduce toil and maximize system uptime. As an aspiring DevOps Engineer and MCA Student at Central University of Karnataka, I focus on building pipelines that are not just fast, but inherently stable and secure.

My expertise is in translating business needs into Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring every deployment is predictable and reversible.

🛠️ The DevOps Toolchain (Skill Matrix)

I organize my technical skills into three buckets based on proficiency:

✈️ The TravelOps Ethos

🌍 I’m passionate about traveling and exploring how technology connects people across borders. I find parallels between robust systems and resilient travel plans.

📸 I often share my journey combining tech, productivity, and adventure — learning from both servers and sunsets ☁️🏔️.

💬 Connect & Build Together

I’m always open to discussing new DevOps projects, IaC best practices, or networking fundamentals. Let's collaborate!
